# Boilerplates-Library: "react" Branch

This branch contains a project template for ALA development that includes:

- helpers: code snippets & functions for quick reuse throughout an app.
- utils: custom hooks used for many purposes (ie useForm, useDates etc.)
- sass partials: custom sass partials with built mixins, variables and animations included.
- "shared" components: a set of reusable and tested components for quick reuse that are "Plug-n-Play".
- assets: a set of reusable sprite sheets separated by purpose and content for quick production.

## TODOS

- [ ] Update <MonthPicker> to handle passing the "year" to the value setter.
- [ ] Update <QuarterPicker> to handler passing the "year" to the value setter.
- [ ] Update "useDates" hook, for Month and Quarter to reflect the required changes to cover support for "year" in the exposed value.
